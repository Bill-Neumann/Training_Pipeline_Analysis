During flight quarters I conducted helicopter refueling evolutions both from the nozzle on the flight deck and from down in the pump room  I conducted deballasting evolutions for well deck operations   I also refueled all marine gear  small boats  LCU s  and LCAC s from the nozzle and from down in the pump room  I also operated  performed maintenance  and made repairs to anchor windlass  steering

knowledge to manipulate rigging lines  hoists  or pulling gear to move or support materials such as heavy equipment  ships  structures  or other loads  Working on projects from both Bremerton and Banger sites  The ability s I learned to attach pulleys to fixed overhead structures such as beams  ceilings  or gin pole booms  using bolts or clamps to move large pieces of equipment  In the inactivation and recycle of nuclear powered submarines and surface ships and the disposal of nuclear reactor compartments for these vessels  Applied my skills to move objects through confined areas where cranes or other mobile material handling equipment cannot be used  Picking valves where there is barley room for one person to be in and lifting it out without damaging the valve I have full understanding on adjusting suspended loads to maneuver around obstacles  using multi point suspension techniques  While attached to Banger I removed a     kw router from the second platform maneuvering the suspended load over  around and through obstacles using multipoint picks  I devised a plane to make standing or running rigging to support  or secure equipment or machinery constructing fixtures to work with equipment so it will be secured when moved or lifted  Good shop practice determines the type of rigging equipment or accessories such as pulley blocks  jacks  chain falls  rollers  beam clamps  plate clamps  dollies  cranes  forklifts or special handling gear to be used in rigging lifts  I used jacking gear to move the reactor packages for transport on barges  Moving cement blocks with crane to raise the RC package  Using forklifts to place plates on the blocks while building the foundation under the RC package  I created a path for moving  and controlling movement of  heavy equipment through narrow openings or in confined spaces  Placing dollies on the deck helped with limited overhead  Making sure all gear used in the lift is clear from damage and damaging anything else  Performing in placement  removal  or repositioning of machinery  structural members of ships or buildings  heavy equipment  or other heavy loads  Lowering down buildings and staging to be used in dry dock in support of vessel work  Estimate weight and center of gravity of loads to be moved  In the recycling program I had to figure out the weight of the steel being removed  Lifting a scope you need to know the weight and how much weight you can apply  I had to working out details from rigging specifications to complete work assignments  Setting up rigging gear on the pier to be used for divers and changing at a notice if plains change  Instruct others to comply with safety standards  regulations  or job guides  technical orders  or operating procedures  Fallow safe work practices  including the use of appropriate protective equipment hardhat  safety glasses  steel toe boots and gloves  Perform my duties with the highest level of attention to safety  health and will take initiative to make the work area safe for myself and others  Report all safety violations which prevent or impedes me from the completion of my assigned duties  Looking up plan standing or running rigging according to written instructions  work requests  blueprints  or sketches  The diver request very spiffed gear to be craned down into the water  Seeing the sketches on how the crane needs to be rigged is very important because of time restraints  Keep the crane moving smoothly and efficiently  Using equipment correctly such as chain falls  gin poles  tackle blocks  gallows frames  or combinations of these to rig objects for movement through confined areas is key  Doing my pre and post check on all my gear makes it a safe rigging operation  Looking at expiration dates  how it s working and any deformities  Selecting gear such as cables  pulleys  or winches  according to load weights or sizes will help from overloading the equipment and piece being lifted  Fabricate  set up  or repair rigging  supporting structures  hoists  or pulling gear  using hand or power tools  Clean and maintain working area and ensure tools and equipment are secured at the end of each day
